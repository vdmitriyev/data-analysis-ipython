### About

A simple python script that uses OpenCV to fetch images from the camera and uses [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) to recognize persons on them.

### Dependencies

* Install Visual Studio with C++ compiler first
* Then install package listed inside "requirements.txt"
	+ For original setup of this repo, the anaconda was used as base

### Usage

* One may want to use such CMD file as "startOpenCVCMD.bat"
* Put your images into folder 'images'. Organize them in a way that each person will get his/her own subfolder inside the 'images' folder.
